' General notes on implementation and design
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

' Most of the pointer type parameters used in the FreeImage API are actually
' declared as Long in VB. That is also true for return values. Out parameters are
' declared ByRef, so they can receive the provided address of the pointer. In
' parameters are declared ByVal since in VB the Long variable is not a pointer
' type but contains the address of the pointer.

' Some of the following external function declarations of the FreeImage 3 functions
' are declared Private. Additionally the token 'Int' is appended to the VB function
' name, what means 'Internal' to avoid naming confusion. All of these are declared
' as 'const char *' in C/C++ and so actually return a string pointer. Without using
' a type library for declaring these functions, in VB it is impossible to declare
' these functions to return a VB String type. So each of these functions is wrapped
' by a VB implemented function named correctly according to theFreeImage API,
' actually returning a 'real' VB String.

' Some of the functions are additionally provided in an extended, call it a more VB
' friendly version, named '...Ex'. For example look at the 'FreeImage_GetPaletteEx'
' function. Most of them are dealing with arrays and so actually return a VB style
' array of correct type.

' The wrapper also includes some derived functions that should make life easier for
' not only a VB programmer.

' Better VB interoperability is given by offering conversion between DIBs and
' VB Picture objects. See the FreeImage_CreateFromOlePicture and
' FreeImage_GetOlePicture functions.

' Both known VB functions LoadPicture() and SavePicture() are provided in extended
' versions calles LoadPictureEx() and SavePictureEx() offering the FreeImage 3´s
' image file types.

' The FreeImage 3 error handling is provided in VB after calling the VB specific
' function FreeImage_InitErrorHandler()


' All of the enumaration members are additionally 'declared' as constants in a
' conditional compiler directive '#If...#Then' block that is actually unreachable.
' For example see:
'
' Public Enum FREE_IMAGE_QUANTIZE
'    FIQ_WUQUANT = 0           ' Xiaolin Wu color quantization algorithm
'    FIQ_NNQUANT = 1           ' NeuQuant neural-net quantization algorithm by Anthony Dekker
' End Enum
' #If False Then
'    Const FIQ_WUQUANT = 0
'    Const FIQ_NNQUANT = 1
' #End If
'
' Since this module is supposed to be used directly in VB projects rather than in
' compiled form (mybe through an ActiveX-DLL), this is for tweaking some ugly VB
' behaviour regarding enumerations. Enum members are automatically adjusted in case
' by the VB IDE whenever you type these members in wrong case. Since these are also
' constants now, they are no longer adjusted to wrong case but always corrected
' according to the definition of the constant. As the expression '#If False Then'
' actually never comes true, these constants are not really defined either when running
' in the Vb IDE nor in compiled form.


'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' ToDo and known issues (unordered and with no priority)
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

' ToDo: implement scanline conversion functions

' ToDo: implement FreeImage_GetBits wrappers for some more data types like RGBTRIPLE and RGBQUAD

' ToDo: implement image alpha transparency helper functions

' ToDo: implement OlePicture aware wrapper functions for many of the toolkit functions

' Bug:  FreeImage_PaintDC paints more scan lines than needed

' ToDo: support better clipping for FreeImage_PaintDC

' ToDo: currently poor and experimental support of tag accessing functions

' ToDo: implement ICC Profile function wrappers (do we need that?)

   ' This function is a easy-to-use wrapper for rescaling an image with the

   ' The parameters 'vntDstWidth', 'vntDstHeight' and 'bIsPercentValue' control
   ' the size of the new image. Here, the function tries to fake something like
   ' overloading known from Java. It depends on the parameter's data type passed
   ' through the Variant, how the provided values for width and height are
   ' actually interpreted. The following rules apply:
   
   ' In general, non integer values are either interpreted as percent values or
   ' factors, the original image size will be multiplied with. The 'bIsPercentValue'
   ' parameter controls whether the values are percent values or factors. Integer
   ' values are always considered to be the direct new image size, not depending on
   ' the original image size. In that case, the 'bIsPercentValue' parameter has no
   ' effect. If one of the parameters is omitted, the image will not be resized in
   ' that direction (either in width or height) and keeps it's original size. It is
   ' possible to omit both, but that makes actually no sense.

   ' TextBoxes, Frames and even PictureBoxes. So, the hole VB application is

   ' provided images. Although the PictureBox control is resized, the containing
   ' image remains untouched. This problem could be solved with this function.

Public Function FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray(ByRef data As Variant) As Long

Dim lpArrayPtr As Long

   ' This function destroys an array, that was self created with a custom
   ' array descriptor of type ('fFeatures' member) 'FADF_AUTO Or FADF_FIXEDSIZE'.
   ' Such arrays are returned by mostly all of the array-dealing wrapper
   ' functions. Since these should not destroy the actual array data, when
   ' going out of scope, they are craeted as 'FADF_FIXEDSIZE'.'
   
   ' So, VB sees them as fixed or temporarily locked, when you try to manipulate
   ' the array's dimensions. There will occur some strange effects, you should
   ' know about:
   
   ' 1. When trying to 'ReDim' the array, this run-time error will occur:
   '    Error #10, 'This array is fixed or temporarily locked'
   
   ' 2. When trying to assign another array to the array variable, this
   '    run-time error will occur:
   '    Error #13, 'Type mismatch'
   
   ' 3. The 'Erase' statement has no effect on the array
   
   ' Although VB clears up these arrays correctly, when the array variable
   ' goes out of scope, you have to destroy the array manually, when you want
   ' to reuse the array variable in current scope.
   
   ' For an example assume, that you want do walk all scanlines in an image:
   
   ' For i = 0 To FreeImage_GetHeight(dib)
   '
   '    ' assign scanline-arary to array variable
   '    abByte = FreeImage_GetScanLineEx(dib, i)
   '
   '    ' do some work on it...
   '
   '    ' destroy the array (only the array, not the actual data)
   '    Call FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray(dbByte)
   ' Next i
   
   ' The function returns zero on success and any other value on failure
   
   ' !! Attention !!
   ' This function uses a Variant parameter for passing the array to be
   ' destroyed. Since VB does not allow to pass an array of non public
   ' structures through a Variant parameter, this function can not be used
   ' with arrays of cutom type.
   
   ' You will get this compiler error: "Only public user defined types defined
   ' in public object modules can be used as parameters or return types for
   ' public procedures of class modules or as fields of public user defined types"
   
   ' So, there is a function in the wrapper called 'FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr'
   ' that takes a pointer to the array variable which can be used to work around
   ' that VB limitation and furthermore can be used for any of these self-created
   ' arrays. To get the array variable's pointer, a declared version of the
   ' VB 'VarPtr' function can be used which works for all types of arrays expect
   ' String arrays. Declare this function like this in your code:
   
   ' Private Declare Function VarPtrArray Lib "msvbvm60.dll" Alias "VarPtr" ( _
         ByRef Ptr() As Any) As Long
         
   ' Then an array could be destroyed by calling the 'FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr'
   ' function like this:
   
   ' lResult = FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr(VarPtrArray(MyLockedArray))
   
   ' Additionally there are some handy wrapper functions available, one for each
   ' commonly used structure in FreeImage like RGBTRIPLE, RGBQUAD, FICOMPLEX etc.
   
   
   ' Currently, these functions do return 'FADF_AUTO Or FADF_FIXEDSIZE' arrays
   ' that must be destroyed using this or any of it's derived functions:
   
   ' FreeImage_GetPaletteEx()           with FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayRGBQUAD()
   ' FreeImage_GetPaletteLong()         with FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray()
